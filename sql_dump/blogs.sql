This is perfectly normal. However, if you’re finding yourself feeling unhappy at work more often than not, then you need to take action!', '\r\n        <h1> Unhappy At Work?  - what to do next</h1>\r\n        <p>We all have the occasional down day at work – when you’re stressed about meeting a deadline, a colleague’s mistake has a negative impact on you, your boss is in a foul mood, or when things just don’t seem to go your way. This is perfectly normal. However, if you’re finding yourself feeling unhappy at work more often than not, then you need to take action!</p>\r\n<p>Feeling unhappy at work makes us less productive, less healthy and therefore generally less successful. Do you like feeling miserable? We’re guessing you don’t, so it’s important that you do not let yourself get stuck in a daily routine of misery (it’s surprising how many people do). To avoid this, you need to pinpoint the reasons for your unhappiness at work.</p>\r\n<p>Don’t be afraid to fall out of love with your job, it happens. Here’s some advice to help you find the career that makes it worth getting out of bed in the morning.</p>\r\n<p>We see numerous people every week who are unhappy in their current jobs and want a new challenge. There are a number of common reasons why:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Salary</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2. The Work</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Colleagues</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Progression</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Stability</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Flexibility</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">3 things to ask yourself if you’re unhappy at work and unsure what to do next</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br>\r\n</span></strong> </p>\r\n<p><strong>1: What’s the problem?</strong></p>\r\n<p>What tasks, activities, and projects occupy most of my day? If I were performing those same activities with different people within my same company, would I be happy? What if I were performing those activities with the same team in a different organization?</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes unhappiness is in one area. You sit in an extremely loud area of the environment, your manager is intolerable and colours your entire work experience, and before you know it, you’re going from, “I hate my&nbsp; manager” to “I hate my job! I need to get out of here.”</p>\r\n<p>But what happens when you put your emotions (and their source) in perspective. Realizing you love your team but hate taking customer complaints is valuable info, as is knowing that your daily commute is causing you mental anguish.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, if your list includes literally everything about your job - your micromanaging boss, the work itself, the CEO, the location, your compensation, limited perks, and so on - then it may really not be you that’s the problem</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2: How long has the problem persisted?</strong></p>\r\n<p>When I think back over the past six to 12 months, are there similar patterns of unhappiness? Have I always been unhappy in this position, or is this new? If I haven’t always felt this way, can I trace my unhappiness to a particular incident? Stock take, quarterly audit, etc.</p>\r\n<p>There are bound to be ups and downs no matter where you are and who you work for. If you’re an accountant, tax time’s always going to be a stressful period. If you’re a chef, quarterly health and hygiene inspections and reports may always make you slightly crazed. If your team is being restructured, you can expect to feel some turmoil during the transition. How am I going to cover the shifts, etc? </p>\r\n<p>If your dissatisfaction’s relatively new, it may be a blip on the radar that’ll resolve itself over time, particularly if you can trace your discontent to a temporary situation, like a co-worker going on leave, or a new boss bumbling along as he finds his way.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, though, your job is just a bad fit. If you’ve never really been satisfied in your current position, expecting things to “get better” on their own is probably unrealistic. And if there’s nothing that you can do personally to make your situation better, it probably is a signal that it’s time to leave.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3: What do you want?</strong></p>\r\n<p>What would my ideal work experience - activities, team members, company - look like? If I was in charge of this company, what three changes would I make immediately?</p>\r\n<p>By comparing your uncensored “ideal” to your “reality,” you can identify mismatches. Once you see those gaps, ask yourself, “How likely is it that this will change for the better?”</p>\r\n<p>If your first move as company president would be to fire the entire management staff and re-create the company’s product line, you’re in for an uphill battle. But if your top priority would be to pipe music in the employee cafeteria, you’ve got a better chance of finding lasting happiness at your current company, because your disconnects are relatively minor.</p>\r\n<p>Before you give up on your current company, see what you can salvage. It’s often much easier to transfer to a new role within your same team or company, than to start over from square one somewhere else.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Make a positive change</strong></p>\r\n<p>Think about what changes you can make to feel happier at work. Is your situation fixable? If it is, try having an open discussion with your Manager and see whether things improve.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Find a new job</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you are consistently unhappy at work and can’t see how the situation is going to get any better then it’s definitely time to start looking for a new job. Your health and happiness is important. It can be a challenge and it can be scary if you don’t like too much change, but it will be worth it in the long run.</p>\r\n<p>Don’t settle for a mediocre role that makes you unhappy and hinders your success. There is something better out there for you!</p>\r\n<p>I’d love to say there’s an absolute “right” and “wrong” time to leave your company, but it’s not that easy. Choosing whether to quit is a multi-faceted decision that requires some serious reflection. </p>\r\n<p>Compare your reality with your dreams, and see how far off you are. The “ideal” position for you is out there somewhere, but finding it may be like moving across a chessboard: You might have to make a few lateral moves before you get headed in the right direction.</p>\r\n<p>Before you draft your resignation letter, the survey below reveals that quitting wasn’t the key to being unhappy. 64% said that talking to a manager was step number one in order to sort things out, followed by reflecting on what’s&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>making you unhappy at 52%.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>The 10 most common reasons for being unhappy with your job</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Not being paid enough – 38.9 percent</li>\r\n    <li>No room for progression – 32.6 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Poor company culture – 30.8 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Poor work-life balance – 21.8 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Boring daily routine – 18.7 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Disliking the working hours – 15.3 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Disliking the boss – 14.9 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Having a long commute – 13.6 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Disliking colleagues – 5 percent</li>\r\n    <li>Issues in private life affecting work life – 4.8 percent</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Are you unhappy with your current position?&nbsp; Should you quit your job?&nbsp; Do you need some assistance in sorting out your job and job search options?&nbsp; If so, contact Hospitality Search International to find out how we can help.</p>\r\n', '/images/blog_images/blog_1.jpeg', '2021-04-08 15:21:32', '2021-04-06 15:21:32'),
(2, '24 difficult interview questions and how to answer them', 'Difficult interview questions are becoming more common in recruitment processes in an effort to identify the best talent.\r\n\r\nThe difficult interview questions they ask you are designed to separate great people from exceptional people.', '\r\n        <p>Difficult interview questions are becoming more common in recruitment processes in an effort to identify the best talent.</p>\r\n<p>The difficult interview questions they ask you are designed to separate great people from exceptional people.</p>\r\n<p>The difference between the two can be bridged by one thing:</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Preparation.</strong></h3>\r\n<p>We’re going to show you a large sample of potentially difficult interview questions. These can be worded differently to how we present them. Trust us when we say that there is a right answer to every question they ask, as well as a whole host of wrong ones.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Why are you looking to leave your current role?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: You can trip up rather easily here by badmouthing your current or former employers. They won’t want to be the next company you have negative things to say about.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “My current role, while enjoyable, isn’t providing me with the challenge or progression that I need at this stage of my career. I am keen to remain in a similar role, but I am seeking extra responsibilities and new projects, which I believe this role provides.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Myself and management just don’t get along. They seem to have some sort of irrational vendetta against me and seem intent on stripping me of all creative freedom. Given that they don’t know as much as I do, I think they’re being quite rude.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>2. What is your passion/what motivates you?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: Employers want to know what makes you get out of bed in the morning. They need to know that the role you have applied for will keep you not just busy, but also engaged.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I’m motivated purely by a desire to push myself as far as I can. I need a role where I can learn and challenge myself. I like to surpass targets and hit deadlines early, as it gives me a sense of achievement at the end of the day.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “The weekend. And money. I want to make it rain come pay day.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>3. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: It’s very easy to go too far when answering this question. Be realistic with your expectations, and don’t come across as a threat to other people’s jobs.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I see myself as an invaluable worker who is making a visible impact on the way the company runs and the results it delivers. I can see myself having more responsibility and ownership over projects as well.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “In your seat” is often a poor choice of answer. While it sounds smart, it can come across as you wanting to put the interviewer’s job under threat. Even worse is “Sitting on a beach earning 20%”, though that could win style points for quoting Die Hard, the ultimate Christmas film.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>4. Describe yourself in three words.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: The difficulty here lies with two key factors. The first is that a lack of preparation can leave you at a loss for adjectives. The second is relevance and balance.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “Diligent, methodical, reliable. I apply myself well, while maintaining a high standard of method, execution and precision and I can be counted on to meet deadlines and be punctual.” It’s also important here to go through examples of diligence, method and reliability; without these, any three words you pick are just that: words.</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Dedicated, straightforward, fearless.” Chances are you’re none of these. Dedicated is one of those “nothing” words everyone uses. Straightforward tends to mean “say it like it is, brutally, and with little regard for other people’s feelings”. And no, you’re not fearless, you’re afraid of heights.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>5. No really, what is your actual key weakness?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: You’ll always be asked what your weakness is, and you’ll have prepared an answer which turns a negative into a positive. This iteration of the question forces you to admit where you’re really weak, and what you intend to do to improve and develop.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: Be honest, but pick your mildest weakness. Even here, justify why you are the way you are by inserting as much positivity as you can into your reasoning.</li>\r\n    <li>“I’m not super-skilled with Java, and I know that this role gives the successful applicant exposure to that. However, I am an assured hand with C+ and other object-oriented languages, so I’m sure I can get up to the speed required quickly.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “I’m not comfortable with the idea of not being the smartest person in the room. As a result, if I have knowledge that others don’t have about something, I tend not to share it to retain a sense of power.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>6. Why have you been out of work for so long?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: Some employers could be really put off by the idea of someone who is work-rusty. You have to explain that your time out of work wasn’t wasted.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I decided to take a short career break. I wanted to take time out to see more of the world, recharge my batteries and learn new skills. You’ll see that during my time out I gained my PRINCE2 qualification, so you can see that I wasn’t spurning my time.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “The new Call Of Duty came out. Finding work could wait, but I’ve been looking for work since I completed it.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>7. How do you deal with criticism?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: During your career, you will constantly receive criticism, both of the constructive and hurtful variety. You have to show them that criticism is something that you can handle.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “Criticism is something I’m always welcome to. I know that some of it can be hurtful, but it’s the best form of advice you can receive. I take every word I receive and turn it into action.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Criticism is often negative; I’d rather receive praise for what I do well.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>8. What appeals to you the least about the company/role?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: The dreaded opposite of “what appeals to you most about the role”. You applied to this role because you enjoy it, so if there is anything that concerns you, you must turn it into a positive.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “There’s nothing that concerns me about the role. If there was, I wouldn’t have applied! The location isn’t as glamorous as other offices I’ve seen, but I don’t plan on spending my time looking out of the window. Your products and the challenges offered by the role are enough to engross me.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Helping out with ad hoc office tasks. After all, I’m a skilled developer, not an admin!”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>9. How do you prioritise your workload?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: Employers want to know what you view as not just your most important tasks, but also what’s important to the company.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I like to take a step back and think of the impact each task has on the project. The tasks with greater end-user importance always move to the top of the list, whilst projects with more distant deadlines hold up the bottom of the list.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “I like doing the fun stuff first and leaving the boring stuff ‘til last!”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>10. How do you deal with conflict and confrontation in the workplace?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: Every office seems to have one abrasive, confrontational, overbearing jerk. Prove you’re not that guy.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I try not to get involved in conflict, not even as a peacekeeper. Ultimately, I come into work to do my job to the highest standard possible, and getting into petty fights and arguments with my colleagues isn’t going to help me or the company.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Left hook, right hook, uppercut, down. I’m like a young Mike Tyson.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>11. Why should we hire you?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: It seems like such an obvious question, but it can be so hard to answer if you’re caught on your heels.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: While your specific answer will be dependent on your own key selling points (number of languages you can code in, level of experience, approach to problems, etc), they’re really looking to see you sell yourself. Plan this answer to last less than a minute, and pick three of four of your best, most unique qualities to use as your elevator pitch. You need to come across confidently and clearly to sound as memorable as possible. I would also pick at least one, meaty example to back up everything you say.</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “I got a B in technical drawing!”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>12. Give me an example of a time when you failed.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: It’s hard to admit failure, for one, but employers want to see what positives you draw from bad experiences, and how you learn for them.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: You should follow a structure here. It’s all in your leg… or baby cow… or baby dugong… or caribou… you get the idea.</li>\r\n    <li>Cause: What did you do which resulted in the failure? Maybe you missed some bugs that were in your code, or you designed a product which didn’t take off.</li>\r\n    <li>Aftermath: What were the consequences of your decision?</li>\r\n    <li>Lesson: What did you learn from your failure? What would you do differently? What will you do next time?</li>\r\n    <li>Fallout: How did you handle any repercussions of your failure?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>How not to answer it: Something inane, like “I once ate 14 bowls of cereal and felt like I was going to die”, or something seriously bad, “I once sabotaged a colleague’s project to get ahead.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>13. How do you get a giraffe in a fridge? (obscure questions designed to test your ability to think)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: Not only physically impossible to get a normal-sized giraffe into a normal-sized fridge, you’re likely to overthink this question and get the answer totally wrong. This question comes in many different forms.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “Open the door, put the giraffe in the fridge, close the door.” If you keep things simple, you will go far. Yes, this answer is totally illogical, but it’s also the right answer. I’d prefer “Build a fridge around the giraffe”, as it shows your ingenuity and craft, but whatever takes your fancy.</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Brute force. Ram it in until it fits - it’s going in that fridge whether it wants to or not.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>14. What achievement are you most proud of?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: Justifying why you are proud of it is what makes this hard. They want to see how inspiring you are, and whether you’ve done anything worthwhile with your life up until now.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “At university, I always tried to fill my spare time with activities that were going to help me in the long run. As someone who invests a lot of interest in the mobile industry, I have developed a number of different apps. One of them was a little platformer game which took advantage of tilt technology, and it actually got put forward for a UK [app] Design Award. Given my relative age and lack of experience, I was so proud to receive such an accolade.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Just passing my degree was an achievement in itself!” is an awful thing to say. “I once assembled an IKEA chair in less than 5 minutes”, while mildly impressive, is completely irrelevant and quite minor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>15. How do you feel about reporting to a younger person?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: This is a test of respect. If you’re the sort of person who believes that power comes with age and not those who work hard for it, this can be difficult to answer.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “Age is just a number; in fact, young people often bring a refreshing attitude and outlook to senior positions. If they are excellent at what they do then I have no problem reporting to them.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “I don’t like taking instructions from younger people. It’s a bit like your son telling you to go to your room when you’ve been naughty, it just isn’t right.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>16. What would you expect to achieve in your first 6 months?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: This question tests your ability to manage your own expectations. You should neither overestimate nor underestimate what you would want to get done.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I’m not expecting to come in and set the company alight on day one. I realise that it could take anywhere from 6 months to a year before my impact is truly felt. However, I do believe I can come in and impress internally, map out my own ways of doing things and have a total understanding of all the products you develop by then.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “I want to come in and make an impact from day one. Come six months from now, I’ll be a manager here.” or “Passing my probation period is success enough for me!”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>17. What three skills do you have that make you a perfect candidate for this role?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: This is about selling yourself as a unique candidate, but also prioritising your skills to match the needs of the company. It’s important to back up everything you say with examples, too.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I would say that I am versatile in the sense that I can program in a variety of different languages full stack. I have proven over time to be highly competent across C+ and Java. I also have the necessary communication skills to effectively communicate with both internal and external clients, as well as members of my team, and my previous experience proves this. Finally, I am a logical thinker; I’m able to take that extra step back and look at problems from as wide a view as I can in order to find the best, most creative solution.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “I’m a great coder, I’m a hard-worker and I always get to work on time.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>18. Have you ever had to make a tough decision for the benefit of the company?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: This is a test of your decision-making metal. In life, you can’t please everyone and you’ll have to make unpopular decisions for the betterment of the company. Those who have backed out of the harder decisions may not be leadership material.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “In my view, the toughest decisions affect people. In my last role, I was senior enough to have to make the decision of who to make redundant and who to retain. We were going through a period of instability in the wake of the recession and we couldn’t afford to keep everyone on the books. The decision wasn’t easy, and was emotionally heart-wrenching, but I did my best to help those who I made redundant find work through recommendations and an excellent reference.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “There was a developer on our team who hated the glare of sunlight in his eyes. I took it upon myself to swap seats with him. It was a tough decision with many consequences, but his quality of life at work has drastically improved.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>19. Do you consider yourself to be a leader?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: It’s hard to define yourself as a leader; it’s normally a title bestowed upon you by someone else. In other words, you’re only a great leader if those around you think you are.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “I would say that I have many qualities that good leaders possess. As previously discussed, I have it in me to face tough decisions head on, and in my previous positions I was always looked up to for guidance. I always make myself available for people and that really helps keep morale high. My peers would say that I am selfless, which is the most underrated leadership quality one can have.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “Yes. I’m the loudest voice in the room and I can organise the hell out of a bar crawl.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>20. How would you react if you didn’t get promoted within, say, 3 years?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: This question is designed to provoke your real motivations and career aspirations, as well as your patience.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “There are reasons for everything. If I didn’t receive a promotion when I felt like I deserved one, the last thing I would do is suspect foul play. I’d take a look at myself, look at the work I have done and focus on the positives. I would request a performance review to see where I am at and to see where I can improve and focus on the future rather than the present.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “I’d leave. If I feel like I deserve a promotion, I should get one!”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>21. How do you measure your success?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Why this is a difficult interview question: People shouldn’t be satisfied with aggressive mediocrity. How achieve and measure a “success”?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How to answer it: “First of all, it is important to clarify my definition of success. Success is going above and beyond what is expected of you, and is much more than just making your superiors happy. As a web developer, Google Analytics allows me to measure how well a new site is doing compared to the former version, and surveys and reviews of a positive nature let me gauge the usefulness and effectiveness of site features.

Soon, all new websites will be designed for mobile devices first before they are designed for the web. Nearly 1/3 of the FTSE100 companies weren’t prepared for the mobile era. The paradigm is shifting, and it will be interesting to see how and if big corporations will adapt to changing consumer needs.”</li>\r\n    <li>How not to answer it: “There’s going to be more developers and stuff.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>24.

This way you ensure your start has a positive impact on the rest of your career.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Take some time off between jobs</strong></p>\r\n<p>Don’t rush headlong into your new job. It’s better to take it slow and use the extra time to prepare. When you start your new role it will be a busy time, so make sure your batteries are fully charged so you can give your new role 100% in terms of focus and energy.</p>\r\n<p>“If you are able to, taking a few days off or a holiday between jobs can help you to mentally transition from one company to another. It will give also you time to separate from your last employer, and get excited about the new opportunity. Your new employer should be amenable to a start date to allow this. If you brought this up during the interview process, your new employer should already be aware.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New job transition </strong></p>\r\n<p>Like everything in life, “you only get out what you put in”. This means you need to put in some legwork and preparation beforehand. This will in turn make sure you start your new job on the correct footing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Before you officially start</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Focus on your new job and routine for the first weeks before you start. Get your sleep in: sounds crazy but if you’re tired, you’re unlikely to perform at your best. It will also show to others around you if you’re tired and washed out. This is even more important if you haven’t had a regular routine beforehand.</li>\r\n    <li>Work out your new route. If you wake up on the day and realise you don’t know where you’re going, chances are you’re probably going to be rushing around and may be late. So, before the big day comes, do some research and work out which way you’re going to go. Look at directions, distances, routes, travel times and public transport, road traffic whatever means of travel you use. Also, check if there are any traffic works going on that could disrupt you. Remember - it’s all about preparation. You do not want the embarrassment in the first few days to say, “sorry I’m late”.</li>\r\n    <li>Show how keen you are by making sure you get to your new job in good time. Arriving 10-15 minutes before you start will always leave a good impression.</li>\r\n    <li>Do more in-depth company research. You probably did a fair amount of research before your interview, so you should know a lot about the company already. Some of this may be covered on your induction and on boarding processes, however it’s always to show willing do some of your own research. This will also stop you from going into a new job cold and looking like you don’t have a clue about the ethos of the company.</li>\r\n    <li>Unless you are being given a uniform, one of the areas you need to address is your work attire. Refresh your wardrobe. Very much like an interview, but with your new work colleagues, you want to make a good first impression and not look like you have been “dragged through a hedge backwards”. The kind of environment you are going to work in will most likely dictate what you need to wear, whether it be formal or informal wear. You may have been given this information already. If in doubt, you can always contact the company to find out.</li>\r\n    <li>Set yourself new job goals. When you start your new role it’s good to watch, observe and follow for an indeterminate time. Once you know what projects you’re going to be working on specifically, think about what you’d like to achieve within a set time. That could be a month or two or three. Be realistic – you’re not going to change the world in 3 months but try and set goals that will push you quite a bit and help you get off to a strong start. This will also give you something to aim for.</li>\r\n    <li>When you have done your induction and “onboarding process” read through your induction packs and any other official document you have been given by the company. These will have a lot of important information about your employment, your responsibilities and what you may need to bring with you when you start work. Also, make sure you have everything that’s been specifically asked for. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>These are things that can have a big impact on how you perform.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The day you start your new job</strong></p>\r\n<p>You have laid the foundations for your success already, but do not be complacent – now it’s time to build on your foundation. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Wake up early - head to bed early and set your alarm. Give yourself plenty of time to get ready so that you can do so at a leisurely pace and give yourself plenty of time to dress the part. This way you will have time to calmly prepare yourself mentally for your new challenge so the nerves do not build up. Taking your time is a much more favourable approach compared to arriving late, sweaty and anxious. </li>\r\n    <li>Stay cool and be mindful - it’s totally natural to be a little freaked out at the prospect of starting a new job. Honestly, it would be weird if you weren’t nervous about your new role. Your employer expects you to have questions and realizes it will take a little while to get up to speed. Practicing mindfulness can help control your jitters and prevent them from spiralling into productivity-sapping panic. Use the time to clear your mind, listen to your body, and take deep, intentional breaths. Preparing for your first day with this level of mindfulness will prepare you for any ups and downs you may experience. When you encounter an unfamiliar situation that might normally rile you up, take a mental vacation back to that cool, calm place and face the challenge with a clear head.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Be humble, receptive and approachable with a confident and friendly manner and demeanour. Confidence doesn’t mean being really loud or ‘showy’ - this is not a great image to portray on your first day. It is much better to build colleague support and relations by being open, at ease, welcoming and friendly to everyone. Smile, shake people’s hands (if you are in the Middle East remember it is not acceptable to offer your hand to a Muslim female) and say hello. Get to know them. Treating everyone fairly and openly shows true confidence and integrity, rather than trying to be the pre-Madonna or attention-grabber.</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t be scared to ask questions, no matter how simple the question may be. This is a new job with people you don’t know – you’re not going to know everything. Your colleagues know that too, so don’t be scared to ask questions if there’s something you’re unaware of. Like everything else, though, use some common sense too – don’t ask questions for the sake of it.</li>\r\n    <li>It is always important to know what the company or office etiquette is. Different companies have different values and ways of doing things. There is no right or wrong, it all depends on company culture. Some might not mind if you use your phone whilst at work, change your desktop’s background picture, put personal things in your office or even pop onto social media to take a quick breather from work. If you’re in doubt, subtly bring it up with one of your colleagues to find out how things are done there.</li>\r\n    <li>We all would like to be able to retain everything we are told. However, when it’s a new job and until it’s second nature, it may all take some time to sink in. Bring a notebook and pen or ask your boss if they have one, but don’t risk looking unprepared and ill-equipped on your first day at work. Then you can write down all the practices, procedures and other things you need to retain that are not covered in your induction manual.</li>\r\n    <li>Know who you need to meet and what they need from you. Don’t rely on your new boss or HR contact to set up all the meetings and introductions you’ll need to wrap your head around your new job. They don’t necessarily know everything you’ll need to do to prepare for your new role and responsibilities. If you don’t get a guided walk-through on your first day, your second day might present a better opportunity to take a self-guided tour of the premises. At that point, you should have your employee badge and be able to walk with enough confidence to blend right in.</li>\r\n    <li>Offer to make people drinks: yeah, this old classic. Your new colleagues will probably be expecting you to offer to make drinks on your first day, so don’t let them down by not offering to. It’s always a good ice breaker when getting to know colleagues. Also, when people tell you their preferences, do your best to remember them. You might want to write them down.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t stay late for the sake of staying late. if you want to stay late, no one’s going to stop you, unless the premises is being locked up for the day. But don’t just do it because you think it’s going to make a good impression. Doing great work will help you make a good impression. At the same time don’t start “clock watching “ and don’t rush out the door as fast as you can when your shift ends<strong>.</strong></li>\r\n    <li>If you have a company phone, either on site or a mobile, find out if there’s a standard greeting that you should use when answering calls. Also, if your colleagues have office phones, find out if it is required to answer them when your colleagues are away from their desks/ office.</li>\r\n    <li>When communicating with email normally a company will set you up a company’s email signature etc. Find out if there is a standard reply to certain emails or if there are email framework templates you need to use when replying. Remember, emails are pieces of writing and they should be professional in themselves. Space things out nicely, check spelling and grammar, make sure there’s a subject line, don’t forget your attachments (if there are any) and whatever you do, don’t copy in the wrong people or hit “reply all” by mistake. If you do, you won’t look very professional for long.</li>\r\n    <li>Get contact details - if something happens, or if you get ill, you’ll need to inform someone, so get the contact details of your manager or HR manager.</li>\r\n    <li>Work out the lay of the land - each company or office will have its own culture. Some will be quieter than others, while some will be frantic. Take some time to work out which yours is, and therefore how you should act in it.</li>\r\n    <li>Until you get to know your colleagues, listening is the best policy. You then get to find out peoples’ personalities, find out about projects, developments and interactions, which will help you to get up to speed with the company’s work and also find out how to act around your colleagues.</li>\r\n    <li>Keep your manager abreast of your progress and developments, let them know what you’re working on every now and then, or ask for their feedback on something. Also, you might want to instigate some kind of regular catch up, maybe at the end of each week, to go over what you’ve been working on. There is then a two-way traffic on dialog regarding how you feel you are settling in and how they feel you are settling in. This always helps issues from becoming unsurmountable and irreconcilable.</li>\r\n    <li>Be ready for ice-breakers or team building sessions. These can be daunting but they are generally designed to be fun ways of finding out about other people and letting them find out about you, so don’t worry - just go with the flow. What might help is having an introduction prepared that outlines who you are, what you’ll be doing and an interesting fact or two about yourself. There you go - you just broke the ice!</li>\r\n    <li>Think twice about bringing your own lunch. We’ve already touched on what you should bring to your first day on the job. Now, let’s flip that around: Is there anything you should consider leaving at home? Yes. One item you might not want to carry to your new workplace is a premade lunch. While packing your own lunch is usually an effective strategy for saving money at work, it’s not always a practical choice for your first day on the job. We don’t advise bringing a lunch box on your first day, especially if you don’t have an office – you’ll just end up carrying it around. Bring cash or a credit card to pay for lunch at a local restaurant. You may or may not be invited to lunch on your first day and you don’t want to be the one without cash if your peers invite you to come along. Use your first day to get a sense of how your co-worker/ colleagues typically consume their lunches. At their desks, in the break room, in a staff restaurant or out and about. Moving forward, you’ll want to do as the Romans do.</li>\r\n    <li>Depending on whether or not you are a social animal, the early days of your new job are critical and your colleague are the ones most likely to be able to get you over any humps or bumps in the road. Don’t forget they’ve been there themselves. We would recommend you get stuck in socially. In the long run you may not want to go out all the time, but in the early days, you’ll want to show that you’re happy to get out of the office and interact with people in a more casual environment. If you’re offered a place at lunch (remember stay away from alcohol in work time) on your first day of work, or asked to go for a few drinks (even soft drink) after work, just say yes and go with the flow. It’s easier to start off on the right foot than try and play catch up later. In these situations, think about how you will answer these questions.\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>What do you want people to know about you?</li>\r\n        <li>What past experience do you want colleagues to know?</li>\r\n        <li>Who do you know in the industry, shared contacts?</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Don’t isolate yourself. You don’t have to be your companies’ party captain to get in with your colleagues. Simply making an outward effort to connect with them on a personal level is usually enough.</li>\r\n    <li>Ask for a mentor. What better way to show how committed you are than by asking for a mentor on your first day at work? This will show that you really want to learn and let you build a rapport with your mentor. If the company hasn’t got a scheme in place, you may even help to kick-start one.</li>\r\n    <li>Remember that your employer needs you too. Remind yourself that your new employer hired you for a reason. They expect you to perform at a high level, but they also really need you in the role – or they wouldn’t have posted it in the first place. Strive for the right balance between being relaxed and earnest. Don’t coast on the feeling that you are comfortable after a week. The easiest way to fall out of favour with your team is to take an “I don’t need you as much as you need me” approach to your work.</li>\r\n    <li>Be Punctual and efficient. This should go without saying, but you’d be shocked at just how many new hires roll into work late in the first week, dawdle through lunch, or duck out early. Once you’ve eased into your new role, you may earn the right to arrive late, leave early, or take long lunch breaks. The early days are not the days to test those presumptions.</li>\r\n    <li>Have fun. You’ll spend a lot of time in work, so do your best to make it enjoyable. Make friends, do the work well and open up your own opportunities. It’s your career, so make it a good one, fun and enjoyable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Final word</strong></p>\r\n<p>Believing in yourself is key to succeeding in a new job. You will undoubtedly face frustrations and make mistakes as you’re adjusting. Don’t fixate on what you have yet to accomplish. Focus instead on how far you’ve already come and where your hard work will take you next. After all, from a pool of candidates, your new employer chose you for this job - you’ve got this. </p>\r\n<p>Sounds strange, but you won’t be in this job forever, and strange things do happen in business. If you do your job well and are friendly with your colleagues, they may help you get a promotion, or even put in a good word for you elsewhere if things don’t work out for you in this company. Obviously, you don’t want it to come to that, but remember – who you know is as important as what you know. Some of the most important connections you make are those you expect to advance your career. </p>\r\n', '/images/blog_images/blog_3.jpeg', '2021-04-08 12:02:36', '2021-04-08 12:02:36');

As a well-established recruitment company, we have heard all sorts of excuses for turning down job interview offers.', '<p><strong>Preparing for a Job Interview</strong></p>\r\n<p>It never puts you in a good light with an employer or recruiter when you apply for a job and the interview is secured, but you have not done your research beforehand and end up turning down the interview offer. As a well-established recruitment company, we have heard all sorts of excuses for turning down job interview offers. So there are some minor things that you must consider when preparing to apply for a job. These are common mistakes that can certainly be avoided! Research and preparation is critical and this will fall down to you before you apply. One tool you have at hand is Google - it’s a wonderful tool where you can find most information needed to prepare. </p>\r\n<p>So if applying for a job make sure you are prepared to receive and accept an invitation for an interview. Otherwise it can put you in a bad light and burn your bridges and be considered as a time waster.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some things to consider before applying for that job.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it practical to travel to the job location every day?</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you are staying local in in the same area take a look at Google Maps first to check the distance from your home to your possible new job. Will you take the car, bus, plane or camel? Think about </p>\r\n<p>What will the cost be to you?</p>\r\n<p>How long will you travel per day?</p>\r\n<p>Many candidates only decide to put the distance to the test as they travel to the interview and this is strongly not recommended. If Google Maps says the distance is too far, we must trust it. Do not apply for the role unless you are happy to relocate. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take a look at our guidance on relocating for work <a href=\"/why-should-you-relocate-for-work/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Consult with your partner, family or spouse.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Have you considered others? Think about your parents, boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife, children or pets? Do they have any objections or concerns? Do not wait to inform loved ones of the good news only after you have attended the interview or landed a job only to find issues can arise. It is important to consider your inner circle before proceeding with an application. It cannot just be about you, you need to look at all implications and think about the bigger picture.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If you realise it’s not for you it is important to be upfront and say no!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Things happen in life that are unavoidable. If you are suddenly realising this opportunity is not for you, or you got another offer, do not be afraid to tell the truth. Do not go to ground or go off the radar. Candidates bizarrely come down with a bout of sudden food poisoning, someone has been knocked down by a car, or the phone has broken leaving companies and recruiters in the dark. This does not portray you in a great light. So the best policy is honesty. Any employer and recruiter only want what is best for you so remember that honesty is the best policy. Recruiters are your friends and are trying to help and support you. They have no interest in pushing you into an unwanted job so never be afraid to say no. We at Hospitality Search international do not place “round blocks into square holes”.</p>\r\n<p><strong>If it does make financial sense the it should be a no go.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you are planning to relocate to a different country, do your sums first - you should be making financial savings for general living costs for it to be financially viable. It is important to be sure of your financial situation before applying for, or even attending the interview. Make sure you compare like for like if you are earning a Gross salary in Europe, USA or Australia. You are not going to find a job that is paying the same level as an Expat net.</p>\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n<p>UK gross salary = £80K</p>\r\n<p>UK net salary = ~£55K after tax</p>\r\n<p>Expat offering salary equiv\' of £55K + housing etc, plus all expat normal benefits</p>\r\n<p><strong>Evaluate your current role</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you have reached a point where you’re actively seeking a new role, it might be worth taking some time to reflect on what you currently do. Before you consider applying for a new role consider your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in your current role.</p>\r\n<p>Doing this will help you to highlight the things you like and dislike about your current job, what serves you well and crucially, what the pros and cons are for remaining in your current job.</p>\r\n<p>Using this information can help you decide if you should explore new opportunities within your current company, or seek out an entirely new challenge in a new setting.

(5, 'Benefits of Being Multilingual', 'Being a multilingual candidate makes you a candidate for job opportunities that aren’t open to others! Your language skills mean you have much wider market opportunities than most other candidates, and you should use that to your advantage. But how?', '<p><strong>Multilingual Candidate</strong></p>\r\n<p>Being a multilingual candidate makes you a candidate for job opportunities that aren’t open to others! Your language skills mean you have much wider market opportunities than most other candidates, and you should use that to your advantage. But how? First, you must learn how to market yourself as more than just a traditional candidate- you are a multilingual candidate!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of being a multilingual job candidate</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are all kinds of benefits to working with a language other than your native tongue. Bilingual employees not only know how to speak the language, but, in most cases, they also have knowledge about their native country’s culture, which is always an advantage when dealing with international clients.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Translation made easy. Having a bilingual employee makes using localization services easy. The staff member could be in charge of proof reading the translation of the content of the website, a menu or document.</li>\r\n    <li>It is well known that bilingual candidates can switch between tasks a lot quicker than people who know only one language. People who speak several languages can process information faster and more efficiently.</li>\r\n    <li>Often you will be compensated for using a second language. Something to note is that speaking an in-demand language can increase your pay rate! Some companies offer considerable language bonuses for speaking languages that are sought after for the international hospitality market.</li>\r\n    <li>You can break into niche markets. By having fluency in a language other than your native tongue, you have opportunities for work in niche markets that require not only your language skills, but also your other career skills. For example, a candidate who has 15 years of accounting experience, but is also fluent in English and Arabic now has more opportunities than the candidate with the same background who is only fluent in English.</li>\r\n    <li>You can relocate. Speaking another language fluently is an invaluable asset if you’re interested in moving outside your country of birth. For those looking to relocate, having a fluent language other than their native tongue can be an asset in the job hunt- especially for hotels etc that are dealing with international clients. It’s always nice for a client to be able to communicate in their own language when staying at a hotel.</li>\r\n    <li>You can be more competitive. Sometimes the smallest differences between candidates can mean getting a job offer.&nbsp; And in fast growing industries like tourism and travel, sometimes what you need is that edge to set yourself apart from all the other applicants with similar CVs.</li>\r\n    <li>Demand is increasing. Jobs seeking multilingual candidates is a market trend that is rapidly growing. Language skills can be another way to market yourself to hiring managers and recruiters.</li>\r\n    <li>Somewhat ironically, there’s no universal vocabulary for describing bilingualism. Words like ‘proficient,’ ‘intermediate,’ and ‘business-level’ can mean different things to different people. Likewise, candidates may be fluent in one dialect but uncomfortable communicating in another.</li>\r\n    <li>Bridge the cultural gap. An ability to communicate in a second language is valuable, but being able to relate to people from a different background is equally important. Being mindful and considerate of foreign customs and etiquette can go a long way to bridging the cultural gap. For example, shaking hands is a customary gesture in the western world to greet someone but if you travel to Asian countries, bowing might be more appropriate. In the United States we like to smile and make eye contact when introducing ourselves. In foreign countries, these gestures might be deemed unusual or even impolite in some circumstances. In France, it is customary to maintain a certain formality when addressing people by using “Monsieur” or “Madame” followed by the person’s last name, even those you have known for some time. Be aware of what behaviour is acceptable and what isn’t and you will be more successful as a result.</li>\r\n    <li>Travel. Although this is not guaranteed, being bilingual increases your chances of being able to travel. This will be dependent on the company you work for and the nature of your job.</li>\r\n    <li>Take on a second job. If you’re looking to supplement your income or you want to improve your second language skills, you may consider becoming a translator, interpreter or teacher. As a certified translator, you’ll be able to translate written text into your target language and vice versa. As an interpreter, you’ll provide oral interpretation between two parties. </li>\r\n</ul>', '/images/blog_images/blog_5.jpeg', '2021-04-08 12:02:50', '2021-04-08 12:02:50'),

Listen carefully to what they tell you.</li>\r\n    <li>More trials go downhill when the applicant arrogantly or eagerly or naively overshoots the employer’s desires (once he sees my torchon de foie de aigle, he’ll have to hire me – in your dreams) than for any other reason. Your inquiry should cover any special desires in the way of presentation.</li>\r\n    <li>If you are to write and prepare a menu of your choosing, be sure that you have your ingredients sourced and secured ahead of time. Don’t choose hard to get products; If your menu is based on one rare item and you can’t find it, you will fail.</li>\r\n    <li>Prepare a menu that is in line with what the client wants to see, unless he has given you carte blanche to produce what you like. Be realistic on what can be created in the environment going forward. Produce food that you can execute well, be visually pleasing and taste mind-blowingly exquisite. Flavour is the best sales point. The presentation is not quite half the battle, but it is a good 40% of perception</li>\r\n    <li>Following on from this, have you created a menu and sent an ingredient list?</li>\r\n    <li>Be prepared and organized. It is as important that you get your shopping list to the client and / or purchasing agent in time. The tasting is also a trial of your organizational skills. Confirm that everything is there the day before.</li>\r\n    <li>Have you advised of any specific items, equipment or ingredients you need?</li>\r\n    <li>We always suggest you take your own knives - you know what it can be like using other peoples knives, which can lead to cuts etc. Remember, if you are flying to a tasting you will have to declare and check your knives in. You cannot take them on as hand luggage</li>\r\n    <li>Take your own chef jacket and trousers. Anything to increase your comfort zone. There is nothing worse than having to wear a uniform for a tasting that is either too big or too small.</li>\r\n    <li>If you are unsure about anything during the tasting, ask questions before it becomes a problem.</li>\r\n    <li>If you can, do a dry run on the dishes you plan to cook before the tasting. If not, run through the menu and be realistic on how long the preparation is going to take and how long it will take to serve. Have you been given details of the time you will have in the kitchen etc?</li>\r\n    <li>Get enough sleep the night before. This makes more difference than you can imagine.</li>\r\n    <li>Make sure that your timing is realistic. Timing in a strange kitchen is more difficult than in familiar surroundings. It\'s always a good idea to speak to one “go to” person in the kitchen that can tell you where things are.</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes. Really, really, really. At least half of all tastings start late, so be prepared. Avoid items that need a long time but must be served promptly. It is better they wait with an explanation, than that they eat grey meat, clumpy pasty etc.</li>\r\n    <li>If you can, speak with the runner handling your dishes. Make friends with this person because he is the face of your food during this process. Tell them what you are doing and what you will need. Say please and thank you.</li>\r\n    <li>Keep well within your skill comfort zone. A kitchen tasting is no time to push your limits! What you have done a thousand times will taste better and come out more perfectly than the new dish you develop under an unusually stressful situation.</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t try to do more than your best.</li>\r\n    <li>Do something you know you do well. They will be watching you and your expressions some of the time, and looking in full control of the situation is to your advantage.</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t forget the financial aspect. You may not be asked, but know how you would cost your dishes. If this is a location with a 27% food cost and an average cover of $35, choose your items accordingly.</li>\r\n    <li>Be tidy. Be nice. Not only your food is on trial. During the time there your manners and your general behaviour are under scrutiny. If you don’t shake hands with the dishwasher, why not?</li>\r\n    <li>The rest of the staff may well be asked what they think of you. They are not going to cut you slack because you are nervous.</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t take it too seriously. You are not on trial for your life. It’s just cooking. It should be enjoyable - you do it for a living.</li>\r\n    <li>If you make a mistake, own up to it. Don’t make excuses or, even worse, blame someone else. Don’t hope they won’t notice it. Listen to their comments and participate in a discussion if they mention the change.</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t leave the tasting panel before asking if they have any questions - listen to what they have to say. When you are finished ask the client if he has any questions rather than how you did. “I hope you enjoyed the whatever,” is a little less self-centered. Thank him for the opportunity and tell him you enjoyed it.</li>\r\n    <li>Cleaning up after yourself as required is always good practice.</li>\r\n    <li>At a tasting / interview which may last 24-48 hours, you may also dine with the MD, GM or Executive chef. This is a good way to see how the kitchen and service team operate so don’t turn it down if you\'re given the opportunity. However, our advice would be if you are offered alcohol, decline politely - alcohol tends to loosen the tongue and you may say something you will regret later. Ask for a glass of water or a juice instead. You have been under stress, you are tired and possibly a little anxious. This is not a time to touch alcohol, especially with a potential future employer.</li>\r\n    <li>If you find the kitchen in disarray, don’t mention it. If you get the job, you can fix it later. At the end of the day this is why they want to hire you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Tasting Types</strong></p>\r\n<p>With increasing frequency operators are requiring chef candidates to perform “practical application” interviews, more commonly known as “tastings.” Companies large and small conduct them for three main reasons:</p>\r\n<p><strong>The “Stage”</strong></p>\r\n<p>Derived from the French word stagiaire, in this most informal practical the candidate is asked to join the culinary staff for one or more service periods. During service, the candidate is rarely asked to take a lead role but is expected to take on prep tasks and line cooking responsibilities. The chef will be judged on everything they do, especially knife skills, cold and hot cooking techniques, fabrication, communication, and demeanor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The “Chef Tasting”</strong></p>\r\n<p>In this practical, chefs are asked to create their own menu and execute it in the employer’s kitchen and on the employer’s time frame. For this type of tasting it is very important to know whether the employer expects the chef to create items that are exemplary of their “best work” or items that are within the menu concept.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The “Mystery Basket Tasting”</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is the most challenging variation because chefs are challenged to prepare a menu using ingredients unknown until they begin. This practical tests the chef’s general repertoire as well as creativity and skills under pressure. </p>\r\n<p>Whichever variation you are asked to do, adhering to these principles will greatly increase your success.</p>\r\n<p>The tasting is designed to:-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Reveal a candidate’s actual culinary skills</li>\r\n    <li>Provide insight into a candidate’s character under pressure</li>\r\n    <li>Help evaluate culture fit and bring the candidate’s would-be peers and reports into the decision-making process</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>My suggested Do’s and Dont’s for Tasting Interviews</p>\r\n<p>Do’s</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Stick with what you know and do it well. This is an application of your current skills.</li>\r\n    <li>Ask for assistance when using an unfamiliar piece of equipment.</li>\r\n    <li>Be on your best behavior and have excellent manners.</li>\r\n    <li>If asked, keep your critiques of the hotel, staff and current menu to yourself. Be pragmatic. Phrase responses such as “If given the opportunity I might change …”</li>\r\n    <li>Keep the interview professional, and all conversations industry-related.</li>\r\n    <li>Be well-groomed and dress professionally including polished non-skid clogs or appropriate shoes and a crisp plain white chef jacket.</li>\r\n    <li>Be prepared to be interrupted, adding to the pressure. You may be asked to step out of the kitchen for an impromptu meeting. If not at a critical time, you should oblige.</li>\r\n    <li>Make a quick prep list at the onset. Start longer prep time items first.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Dont’s</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Don’t attempt techniques you have not mastered.</li>\r\n    <li>Use dangerous equipment without proper safety training</li>\r\n    <li>Use gruff behavior or cuss – even if your host or their employees do. They’re not on stage … you are.</li>\r\n    <li>Use derogatory language if asked to evaluate the host’s business. You don’t want to be perceived as arrogant or egotistical.</li>\r\n    <li>Discuss your personal life or gossip about other properties or people.</li>\r\n    <li>Neglect your appearance. Remember, you will be there for some time and are being considered for an important role in the hotel so you need to look the part at all times.</li>\r\n    <li>Change your menu in the middle of the tasting </li>\r\n    <li>Expect an undisturbed kitchen utopia. (Be ready to clean the robot coupe yourself, with a smile.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Remember - they want you to succeed. Do not be complacent. You still need to convince them that you’re the chef for them, whatever the level of the role is.</p>\r\n<p>Good Luck - hope all goes well and this information helps</p>\r\n', '/images/blog_images/blog_6.jpeg', '2021-04-08 12:02:50', '2021-04-08 12:02:50'),

These tips will help you create an online presence that is both personal and reflective of who you are, while being strong and promoting your career.', '<p>Most hospitality industry professions are aware of the need of an online presence, and the difficulty of balancing personality and professionalism. These tips will help you create an online presence that is both personal and reflective of who you are, while being strong and promoting your career.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Be true to yourself</strong></p>\r\n<p>Being your own authentic self is by far the easiest way to stay on top of your online presence, as you can be genuine, rather than continuously coming up with some kind of persona. Being sincere will also be apparent and make you infinitely more appealing rather that coming across as “bigged up” and fake. Your sincerity will translate to being an honest and trustworthy person. It may seem scary to put yourself out there, and you may be left feeling vulnerable, however the payoff is worth it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Write articles and Q&amp;A</strong></p>\r\n<p>Articles and online posts allow people to get a real insight into who you are, what you do and what your skill level is in you chosen profession. It is also important to answers any questions people may have about you. Whilst doing Q&amp;A about your chosen profession field this is great way to gain publicity, and receive recommendations from external sources. People will be able to see that you are an expert and considered reliable in your field.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Have a professional appearance</strong></p>\r\n<p>The point of having such a strong online presence is to promote yourself professionally, so it’s important to look as professional as possible. This means using professional photography in your photos, and having connections and links with others in your industry. Commenting and collaborating with other online professionals shows your level of skills within the Hospitality industry. </p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Beware of privacy settings</strong></p>\r\n<p>Most have accounts for their careers, and accounts for their own personal use. The privacy on your business accounts may be lower, so people you don’t know can find you and connect with you. However, your personal accounts, where you chat with friends&nbsp;and post personal photos should be private. While you’re entitled to let your hair down, be conscious of what you want potential employers or clients to have access to.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Use online tools to build your online presence</strong></p>\r\n<p>If your career is not in a technical field, then building up your website and social media marketing may be daunting, at which point using online resources can&nbsp;prove to be an asset. One issue many people face today is the fact that there are just so many online platforms though which you can engage with prospective employers, it’s hard to stay on top of all of them.&nbsp;Hoot Suite&nbsp;helps you manage all platforms in one place, while&nbsp;Mention&nbsp;Adwords&nbsp;or Workstream help you monitor the success of your digital marketing, and adapt to trends to make your online profile as effective as possible. While&nbsp;Click to Tweet&nbsp;also monitors the success of your twitter profile, it can also be used to promote your posts. You will need to be visually appealing in order to stand out.&nbsp;And finally, your content should be professional and high quality, so people feel they can trust in your brand. &nbsp;And once you content has been written,&nbsp;Aweber&nbsp;can help make sure it is effectively distributed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Be consistent with your content</strong></p>\r\n<p>You should ideally post regularly, and these posts should be shared across multiple platforms. However, don’t let the frequency of your posts detract from your core message - You, what you do and what you have to offer. At the end of the day you are trying to find a new employer. Even if this means planning your content for the week in advance, you should be on-message at all times and make sure you’re delivering your take on issues, not compromising your opinions just to have something to post, or post on irrelevant topics.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Be strategic</strong></p>\r\n<p>As soon as you make the choice to either launch or re-vamp your online presence, you should write a list of goals. What exactly are you hoping to get from you own online personal brand. Never lose sight of why you have an online presence in order to maximise the results you get from it.</p>\r\n', '/images/blog_images/blog_7.jpeg', '2021-04-08 12:02:50', '2021-04-08 12:02:50'),
(8, 'Cover Letter Tips', 'In the days when you would have applied for a job by post, your cover letter would have been your first chance to `wow’ the employer. Nowadays it’s much more common to apply for jobs online or by email, but the cover letter is still just as important.', '<p>In the days when you would have applied for a job by post, your cover letter would have been your first chance to `wow’ the employer. Nowadays it’s much more common to apply for jobs online or by email, but the cover letter is still just as important.</p>\r\n<p>Whether your cover letter is hand written or electronic, it`ll be the first thing an employer or agent reads. This means it’s a good idea to write something short and snappy that makes your reader want to take a look at your CV or application form.</p>\r\n<p>If you\'re applying to a number of similar positions, then it’s tempting to keep using the same cover letter. However, it’s advisable to change your letter slightly for each position. Don’t forget to update the company, job, and contact information - if Mr. Smith is addressed as Mrs. Jones then your application form could end up in the bin!.</p>\r\n<p>Most importantly, you should always include your contact details. You might already have this information on your CV, but there\'s no harm doubling up.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is an application covering letter</strong></p>\r\n<p>A covering letter accompanies your CV as part of an application for a job. It provides further detail on how your skill set aligns with the role that you are applying for, what you can bring to the team and why you want the position. Cover letters allow recruiters and employers to develop a better understanding of your suitability for a position. You should align your qualifications, relevant skills and past work experience clearly to the job description to emphasise that you have done your research into the role and are keen to join the team and why you feel you should be considered accordingly. This is often where first impressions are made in the mind of an employer, making it one of the most critical components of an application. In addition to this, it has been found that employers often favour CVs that are accompanied by a cover letter.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;A good covering letter will increase your chances of being invited for an interview.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What should your covering letter include?</strong></p>\r\n<p>A good covering letter must always contain the following information:</p>\r\n<p>Name of the sender</p>\r\n<p>Addressee, place and date</p>\r\n<p>Subject (with job reference number)</p>\r\n<p>Your motivation for applying</p>\r\n<p>Your experience and suitability for the role</p>\r\n<p>Always state your motivation and suitability in a positive way.</p>\r\n<p>Conclusion and signature</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">HOW TO WRITE IT</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Type it</strong> - Handwritten letters can be difficult to read or attach to emails and may imply you are not comfortable using technology.</p>\r\n<p>Triple-check it - Many people stop reading a letter at the first mistake, so double check your letter carefully for language, spelling or syntax errors. Computer spell and grammar checks will catch most mistakes but is never fool-proof, so have someone else read through your letter to be absolutely sure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Get a name to address your letter to</strong> – This will ensure you send it to the right person that is handling the recruitment of the role that you are applying for. If there is no name to address the letter to in the job advert, phone to get one. It is generally a good idea to phone in advance to clarify any queries you may have and make yourself known as an interested candidate.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Letter Construction</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n<p>Clearly state what position you are applying for, who you are and why you are interested.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Convince the reader you want the job</strong></p>\r\n<p>What a lot of job seekers don’t realise is that those looking to fill a position may have a valid fear that their ideal candidate will turn down the job or not stick at it for very long. Convince them you really are interested and how it fits in with your (career) plans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Convince the reader that you could do the job</strong></p>\r\n<p>Match the skills and experience you have with what they are looking for. Give examples of qualities they ask for and how you have coped with similar responsibilities in the past. Refer specifically to skills and experience listed on your CV. Make sure you tailor your language: use the phrases they use wherever possible. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Let your personality shine through</strong></p>\r\n<p>Write with enthusiasm and be positive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Be informed</strong></p>\r\n<p>Throughout, show that you have researched the position and the employer. This is called competitive intelligence. Quotes from their (and their competitors’) website or other information you may have will show you have done your homework.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Understand your values, understand their values</strong></p>\r\n<p>A more subtle use of competitive intelligence is to get a good understanding of a company’s values and show how yours match. Having shared values creates a human connection. The same is true for language.</p>\r\n<p><strong>End with a confident conclusion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Summarise what you offer and how that fits perfectly with what they are looking for. Say you are looking forward to the interview to explore the fit. If you are writing a speculative application rather than in response to a job advert, indicate that you will call in a specific number of days (and do so).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Common Cover Letter Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many people fail to really exploit the benefits a great cover letter can provide. They either don\'t include one at all, or they fall into a number of traps that reduce the effectiveness of their letters. Let’s take a look at some of these:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Covering letters must be brief. A maximum of one side of A4. It should be easy to read, with plenty of white space and in a <strong><em>legible font.</em></strong> Writing a long and dense cover letter is counter-productive and the employer will simply not read it.\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>There is no value in a cover letter that merely repeats the information you’ve already given in your CV. Take the opportunity to tell the employer or recruiter something new; something that will help them feel that you are exactly the right candidate for them.\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Candidates who fill their cover letters with lists of skills are missing an opportunity if they do not substantiate them. There is little value to the employer in hearing that you’ve got great team-work skills – everyone says this. But hearing that you’ve demonstrated those skills doing xx, explaining what you brought to that team, and what the team achieved, is of far more interest. It demonstrates that you genuinely are someone with those skills.\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Cover letters must also be specific to the particular role and employer. Any candidate who includes a generic cover letter is showing a lack of commitment and interest in the particular role and the employer will pick up on this. Take the time to really explain why you are interested in the role and what you could contribute. Make it personal.\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>On a similar note, check that the details you’ve included within the cover letter are correct. There’s nothing worse than receiving a cover letter applying for a different role, particularly one that is with a competitor!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You would think sending in a cover letter is better than not sending one in at all, but if you’re just going to phone it in, you’re not doing yourself any favours. In fact, you’re probably wasting your time. So, if you want to reap all those benefits of writing one, make sure you’re giving it your best effort all the way until the end.</p>\r\n', '/images/blog_images/blog_8.jpeg', '2021-04-08 12:02:50', '2021-04-08 12:02:50'),

Businesses in the UAE are looking for talented professionals from overseas, while people in Europe are attracted by the thought of low taxes and a new, exciting experience.</p>\r\n<p>The UAE is a great place for many reasons. Dubai is fast becoming one of the most desirable cities in the world, but it also represents a gateway into so many other parts of the world.</p>\r\n<p>But making the move will be a big challenge. Dubai has become one of the most international cities in the world with foreign workers now outnumbering the local Emiratis, which gives it a uniquely cosmopolitan feeling. Underpinning all that, though, is the rich local culture.</p>\r\n<p>The cost of living is not as cheap as it once was, but unless you want to get wrapped up in the high-flying life of glitz and glamour then you can still save.</p>\r\n<p>Fed up with the soaring prices of life in European capital cities? Then you should give the UAE some serious consideration. The only thing you will have to pay more for is alcohol and women’s fashion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The lifestyle is much stricter </strong></p>\r\n<p>Buying alcohol is difficult. The hotels will serve it but you’ll have to pay a much higher price. Your best option could be to stock up on duty free and drink in private until you get you liquor licence to allow you to buy alcohol for your home. </p>\r\n<p>The dress code varies around the UAE, especially for women. In places such as Dubai it’s much more liberal than elsewhere. For example, women do not have to wear head scarves. Even so it’s polite to respect UAE culture. Tight or low cut skirts are deemed offensive, and if you bare your shoulders you might find yourself warned.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Entertainment </strong></p>\r\n<p>There is something for everyone in the UAE. Whatever you like to do Legal pastime maybe you will find somewhere is the region that you can carry on your interests, whether it be sport or music, etc</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>The weather is hot</strong></p>\r\n<p>… Very hot. It couldn’t be more removed from London if it tried. Out in the desert temperatures soar to more than 40°C in summer and the humidity will make life very uncomfortable. You should keep yourself hydrated and try not to go out at the hottest times of the day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Getting a visa </strong></p>\r\n<p>If you are a European passport holder simply disembark your flight at Dubai International Airport and proceed to Immigration, where your passport will be stamped with a 30 days visit visa free of charge. This is until you employer secures your resident and work visa.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Embrace the difference </strong></p>\r\n<p>Moving to the UAE will represent a much bigger cultural shift than other places and it can take time to adjust. However, these differences can also be exciting. As with so many things in life, much depends on how you accept and embrace the local culture.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Things you need to know when you get there</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>What airport will you arrive at?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are thousands of flights per week from around the world to the UEA into Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Al Ain. Dubai is also a major world airport hub for transit flights\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Local currency</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>UAE Dirham. AED1 is made up of 100 Fills. The currency is pegged to the US dollar. On 12 November 2017 $1 was worth AED 3.67.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you spot a cab?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Taxis are cheap and plentiful in Dubai. The government employs more than 70,000 taxi drivers and runs a fleet of cars.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Price of a hotel room</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>The average price at a 4/5 star hotel is £131 per night. However you can and will be able to find bargain rooms away from the beaches and central locations much cheaper.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Price of a house</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n<p>Apartments in Dubai range from AED4,500 per sq metre in Discovery Gardens to more than three times that price in the upmarket Palm Jumeirah, while villas start at AED5,400 per sq metres. Prices are generally higher in Abu Dhabi.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Price of a pint of milk</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>AED2.57 (1 litre costs AED4.52\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>What language do most people speak?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>Arabic. English is widely spoken, along with Farsi, Hindi and Urdu.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>What tax will you pay?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>One of the big attractions of working in the UAE is its tax regime: it charges no income tax on salaries paid there. If you move part way through a UK tax year you may have some tax to pay at home, but after that your income will be earned tax-free. There are taxes on some services and goods as of 2018 VAT.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>How long will it take to send a letter back to Europe?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>About a week.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do’s and Dont’s</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Do’s</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Do remember that the United Arab Emirates is an Islamic country and follows a tolerant version of Sharia law. </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Be respectful of this, and you’ll have a much better stay, and be more likely to meet locals and explore the heart of the UAE. Insulting Emiratis, even indirectly, with your behaviour could have serious consequences, from fines to imprisonment</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do dress sensibly and respectfully.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Women are advised to wear loose-fitting clothes and skirts that drop to the knee. Men should wear jeans or trousers, and tops with long sleeves. You will see foreigners wearing tight, revealing clothes, and while it’s rarely punished, it does alienate Emiratis\r\n</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Do take taxis directly from hotels to nightclubs.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Drinking and being intoxicated in public is an offence than can get you fined, or land you in jail. Be careful of how you act: it only takes one local person to report you for being overtly drunk to get you in a lot of trouble</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do take your shoes off if visiting someone’s home.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If you enter someone’s home, leave your shoes at the door, and avoid showing the soles of your feet. Similarly, avoid eating with your left hand\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do be aware of opening and closing times.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The weekend in the UAE is Friday and Saturday, and Friday is the equivalent of Sunday in the West.

Many luxury hotels important bottles of European water, such as Volvic and Evian, at a great cost financially and environmentally, so remember to ask for local bottled water, if you’d rather avoid tap water</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do be careful when crossing roads.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Speeding is a common occurrence, so jaywalking and crossing roads without a pedestrian crossing area can result in you being knocked down. This could also incur a fine if you are caught. Therefore you should always cross at a designated crossing area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Do be respectful of Emirati women.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Only shake hands with a woman if she offers her hand first, and do not take photographs without her permission.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don\'ts</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t wear swimwear away from the pool or beach.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Swimwear is perfectly acceptable to wear when lounging by the pool or on the beach, but away from these areas, it’s deeply disrespectful and could get you in trouble</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t display affection in public.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Hand-holding is fine, but anything more than this is an offence, and will offend Emiratis. Similarly, staying in the same hotel room as someone of the opposite sex that you aren’t married to (unless a parent or child), can result in arrest</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t lose your temper.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Swearing or making rude hand gestures in public will get you in trouble, so refrain from cussing the person who nearly knocked you down or cut you up!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t take photographs of government buildings.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Normal tourist photography is fine, but avoid photographing Sheikh’s palaces, ports, airports, police stations and military buildings</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t drink-drive.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This is strictly prohibited, and if you’re involved in an accident and there’s the slightest trace of alcohol in your blood, you will most likely go to jail</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t take drugs.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Taking drugs, bringing them into the country, or even being in the company of those taking illegal substances has dire consequences, with many states in the UAE regarding the death penalty as suitable. Steer clear of anyone offering illegal narcotics</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t eat or drink in public during Ramadan.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The holy month of Ramadan bans eating or drinking in public before sundown, so either eat in your accommodation, or opt for one of the cafes or restaurants that stay open during this time – they’ll pull shutters down over the windows and will know the correct etiquette\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Don’t forget to bargain!</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you’re browsing items in the souks, don’t pay face value – vendors will expect you to haggle, and will enjoy your attempts to lower the price.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hope this information helps</p>\r\n', '/images/blog_images/blog_9.jpeg', '2021-04-08 12:02:50', '2021-04-08 12:02:50');

Do you know what they learned? You should take seriously what is on the web about you and what people can see. In today’s market it could mean the differences between secure a role or not. Take control of what data is online about you and what information people that do not know you can see and visit. It’s time to take your online reputation into your own hands instead of leaving it to Google or other search engines and social media platforms.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some steps you can take:</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why first impressions matter on the internet</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>It\'s no secret that friends, nosy family members, and potential employers may browse Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to look for more information about you when they want it. In the case of family and friends, they already know you. When it comes to potential employers or people interested in working with you, it\'s important to make sure that the things they find about you are representative of who you are (or who you want them to think you are.)</p>\r\n<p>You don\'t have to be a job-seeker to understand the importance of your online reputation. In today technological age it very hard to get away from an “on-line presence” unless you live an “ off the grid lifestyle”. Whatever search engine you use it may seem impossible to control, but there are some clever things you can do. Hopefully these tips below will help you tackle some of these issues. Should you follow them, by the end you\'ll have a better picture of what you want people to find when they search for you. With work, you\'ll even have better control over what they find.</p>\r\n<p>Then take the following three steps</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Step One</span></strong>: Find Out Where You Stand (and Erase Embarrassments)</p>\r\n<p>Before we get started, it\'s a good idea to see what others see when they search for you. Then we can tweak what we find so it\'s representative of the \"you\" that you want the public to see, not just what a search engine collects. Do this by looking on Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask.com, Firefox and any other of the popular search engines. Unfortunately, data collected will vary from search engine to search engine but it will give you an good idea of what data is visible.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Search For Yourself </span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Start with what is considered to be the most popular search engine in the west : Google. You\'ve probably done a vanity Google search before, but if not, now\'s the time. Before you start it is important to log out of your Google accounts or use a browser where you\'re not logged in (Google personalizes results based on your account activity) and search for your name. Don\'t bother going more than a few pages deep, and make note of what you see. Remember, making a good first impression requires actually making an impression. While turning up nothing means no one will find anything bad, it also means they won\'t learn anything good about you, and that can be just as negative to, and perceived as, pretty strange.</p>\r\n<p>Next, check Facebook. You can view your public self on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+:</p>\r\n<p>Remember once again, before you start, it’s important to log out of your accounts as you want to see what others see. You cannot do this when you are automatically logged in, or use a browser or device that you do not know or have not used before.&nbsp; Search for yourself by name. Even if you don\'t use your name as your account ID, it may be easy to find yourself with a quick name search. See if that\'s the case, and see what\'s visible. Take a note of what you find or see - this is what a person you do not know or are not connected to can see.</p>\r\n<p>Log back in and view your profile as “public.\" Facebook, LinkedIn, and Google+ all make it easy to do this from your profile page. This way you can see what your profile looks like to someone who stumbles upon you, even if you\'re not easily found.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Clean Up Any Results You Don\'t Like</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>Now that you\'ve seen what others see, it\'s time to get rid of anything you don\'t like, or feel is not a good personal representation of you. You can guarantee you will have, or even be given, the opportunity to explain the bad stuff away in a phone call or in-person interview. We\'ve discussed how to fix internet embarrassments before. The key is if you are not comfortable with content you see “as public”&nbsp; either hide it so only close associates or family can see it, or delete it completely.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Google and Other Search Engines</strong>: If you found the offending results at Google or another search engine, ask them to remove the pages from their results. Google has a process for this, and another for Google Images, but they only apply to pages that have been taken down, or old, cached versions of pages that are still up - it\'s not for pulling down any old page. Most search engines have a policy where you can submit takedown requests for non-legal reasons.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Deleting is your best option (so no one takes screenshots or makes your private posts public without you knowing.) Alternatively, as mentioned if you do not want to do this, change post visibility individually. (go to privacy settings - limit past post visibility to hide everything at once.) Get familiar with Facebook\'s privacy options, and if the content is on Facebook but not under your control then make sure private posts are truly private. The only things public are the ones that showcase your public persona, so you need to think before you post anything you do not feel comfortable for the world to see.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> Twitter is easy, just look at your profile by name. If your profile is public, everyone can see it, and if you use your real name as your handle, it\'s easy to find. You can make your account private, but that won\'t stop public users from quoting you (although it does stop retweets) or responding to you publicly. Remember, Twitter is probably the most public of all networks. “<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Think”</span></strong> being the optimum word before you tweet, as once it’s out there you cannot turn back the clock. As they say, do not open a can of worms unless you are prepared to defend it. You cannot cry over a perception of yourself after the event.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Google+:</span></strong> Your posts at Google+ aren\'t as important as your Google profile. Hide anything you saw but wanted private when you viewed your profile earlier. Make sure useful details (a contact email address, links to your portfolio or personal web site, etc) are visible. Create topical circles for sharing and familiarize yourself with Google+\'s privacy settings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> If you post articles to LinkedIn, make sure they\'re professional in nature and relevant to the public persona you want to put forward. I would not recommend sharing private or personal posts on LinkedIn as this is not what it’s for. Keep it to your professional and work life and persona. While you\'re there, go ahead and fill out your profile with additional details: odds are your profile may be incomplete, or the last time you updated it was the last time you changed jobs.</p>\r\n<p>If you lead a busy and hectic life, or simply feel this is a technical mine field, you can turn to services that promise to protect your online reputation. They\'re usually effective, but they all cost money. For example, Brand Yourself and Reputation.com (formerly Reputation Defender) will all help streamline this process for you if you are prepared to pay for the pleasure with an ongoing subscription.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Strengthen Your Online Presence with Better Profiles and content</p>\r\n<p>Now that you have successfully removed the bad stuff, it\'s time to build you profile and portray yourself in a good light. Potential employers, business contacts, and people in your network will look you up anyway, so why not make sure that what they find is what you want them to know? This will only lead to good things in the end, however it has to be a true portrayal of yourself. Do not big yourself up with things that are not truthful.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Elevate Your Social Networks.</strong> Your social networks can be valuable tools if you use them in the right way and as they are intended. Update your LinkedIn profile with your interests and skills, not just your work history. Add some relevant interests to Facebook and leave them public. You may even want to like a few job or industry-related pages. Its critical to upload a good-looking clear profile photo to your Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Google profiles, and consider only filling out your photo gallery with flattering shots of you, your work, or even your projects and things you\'ve worked on. Remember, use every opportunity to showcase your skills, talents and interests, whether it\'s in the \"Likes\" section of your Facebook profile, or the photos in your Instagram account. There\'s nothing wrong with food photos on Instagram if you\'re a self-described foodie, for example. Or picture of engines if you are an Engineer. It’s all about portraying you as you. Sign up for new services and sites that can showcase your skills. Keep an eye out for new sites that you could benefit being a part of.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Domain and your own website.</strong> One of the other great areas you should give thought to as a great way to get yourself maximum exposure is to get your own domain and use it as a portfolio and for your professional email. Owning your own domain is extremely valuable and worth more than the money you\'ll pay to get it in the long run. <a href=\"/let-hsi-help-with-personal-domains/\">HSI can help with this</a>.</p>\r\n<p>If you can\'t use your name, pick a domain you\'re comfortable using as your personal banner and use that instead. Once you\'re registered with a great registrar, choose a great hosting company and set up your portfolio yourself, or we at HSIcan do it for you. Your domain can then become your portfolio to showcase yourself, your work and experience and ability. Behind the scenes, use your domain for email. It looks professional and every email you send is an invitation for the recipient to come and see your portfolio full of links to the things you want them to see.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Signing UP-Signing IN.</strong>&nbsp; Make the most of the social media services you use. Make sure all of your profiles are filled out with as much useful information as possible. If you do not feel comfortable in filling in some of the fields they ask you to, ask yourself is this the right social media platform for me? Whatever you do, don\'t just sign up and walk away. Upload good photos of yourself to your social networks and add good content so that potential employers and new friends see you at your best. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Emails.</strong> Use a consistent email address across all of these services so it\'s easy to get in touch with you, and cross-link them to one another frequently. This makes sure anyone who lands on one can easily get to everything else you do, and makes it easier for Google to index the real you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep an eye on the results.</strong> For people who just want a good face and impression, you can stop here. For others who enjoy analyzing how people find them, most nameplate (ie domain and websites) services offer analytics so you can see how people find you and where they click to leave. Add Google Analytics to your personal site and portfolio to see how well you\'re being received, and what people come to your site to see. This way you can keep an eye on who\'s looking for you and what their eyes are drawn to when they find you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Keep Your Best Foot Forward</p>\r\n<p>By now, you\'ve done your homework to find out what other people find when they look for you, cleaned up your profiles and keep it this way with good housekeeping. As you go forward with your shiny, professional online persona, make sure to keep it clean by following the fundamental rules of sharing on the internet: </p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Don\'t post it if you don\'t want it to be public. The internet is a big place with a long memory. Internet Shame Insurance can remind you if you\'re about to post something you might regret. </li>\r\n    <li>Keep in mind that your ideal online first impression doesn\'t have to be a perfect, rosy picture of your personality, just a truthful one. </li>\r\n    <li>Putting your best foot forward keeps you from not being taken seriously or an idiot with radical views, don\'t let it stifle your brilliance or keep you from expressing your opinion and being true to your ideals. After all, those are the things we want people to learn about us when they go looking. Just be mindful of your surroundings and the world we live in as well as what is right &amp; wrong, legal and illegal and the current social mood.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>As the world continues to evolve, it is important that we don’t remain static. And seeing as a lot of this evolution has to do with the web, it is essential for your career and future that you create a strong online presence. However, if you’ve not always been web-savvy, building an online presence can be tiring, confusing and frustrating, even with the numerous options available; from creating different profiles and numerous accounts, to building your website and finally figuring out the best medium through which to engage your target audience. So if you do not know how and where to start when building your online presence, please get in touch with us. We would be happy to help.</p>\r\n', '/images/blog_images/blog_10.jpeg', '2021-04-08 12:02:50', '2021-04-08 12:02:50');
